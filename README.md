Hi, I'm Ahmed 👋


🌟 About Me
Hey there! I’m a mobile dev who’s all about creating seamless experiences for both Android and iOS. I got hooked on coding when I built my first app, and now I’m always chasing the next challenge—whether it’s crafting pixel-perfect UIs or optimizing performance. I thrive on learning, building, and collaborating with cool people.

🔭 Currently working on: Cohouse App - A cross-platform app connecting folks with shared living spaces.
🌱 Learning: Laravel - Leveling up my backend skills to build full-stack solutions.
👯 Open to collaborate on: Open source mobile projects—think Flutter, Android, iOS, or anything innovative.
💬 Ask me about: Flutter, Dart, Android, Kotlin, Java, iOS - I’ve got hands-on experience building apps for both platforms.
📫 How to reach me: moodfactor102@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a coding challenge junkie—give me a puzzle, and I’m in!
